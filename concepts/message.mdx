A Message is a special [Step](/concepts/step). It represents a message from the user, the system or the assistant.

## A simple message

In this example, we create a message with the `message` method. The message is automatically sent to the platform. The type is set to `assistant_message` to convey that it's a message from the AI assistant.


<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"""
Note that we call `client.wait_until_queue_empty()` to make sure all messages and
steps are sent to the platform before the program exits.
"""
import time
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient()

@client.thread
def main():
  client.message(content="Hello world", type="assistant_message", name="Chatbot")
  print("Hello world")

main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()

```
</CodeGroup>

Here is how it looks on the platform:
