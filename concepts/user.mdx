title: User
---

A user can be assigned to a thread, allowing for the tracking of all interactions made by this user.

We have a filter on thread by users:

<Frame caption="User filter">     
  <img
    src="/images/user-filter.png"
    alt="The user filter on threads"
  />
</Frame>

You can access the list of your users from the User page:
<Frame caption="User page">     
  <img
    src="/images/users.png"
    alt="The user page"
  />
</Frame>

To create a User with our SDK:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
new_user = await client.api.create_user(identifier="John Doe")
```
</CodeGroup>
