A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be a conversation between a human and one or several agents, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input...

A Thread is composed of Steps. A Step can be a message, or an internal AI step like an LLM call.

## A simple thread

<CodeGroup>
```python step-example.py
import time
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()


@client.step(type="tool")
def my_tool():
    # do something

    time.sleep(1)

    return "Response from the tool"


@client.thread
def main():
    tool_response = my_tool()

    client.message(content=tool_response, type="assistant_message")
    print(tool_response)


main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
```

## Thread API

There are two ways to create thread. Using the `with` statement or using the decorator on a function.

  <Card title="With statement" icon="w" href="/python-client/usage/create-a-thread#using-the-decorator-on-a-function">
