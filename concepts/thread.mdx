title: "Thread"

A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be, for example, a conversation between a human and one or several assistants, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input.

A Thread is composed of [Steps](/concepts/step). A Step can be a message, or an intermediate AI step like an LLM call.

## A simple thread

<CodeGroup>
```python
import time
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()


@client.step(type="tool")
def my_tool(input: str):
    # do something

    time.sleep(1)

    return "Response from the tool"


@client.thread
def main():
    tool_response = my_tool("Hello world")

    client.message(content=tool_response, type="assistant_message", name="Chatbot")
    print(tool_response)


main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Thread API

There are two ways to create thread. Using the `with` statement or using the decorator on a function.
