title: "Thread"
---

A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be, for example, a conversation between a human and one or several assistants, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input.

A Thread is composed of [Steps](/concepts/step). A Step can be a message, or an intermediate AI step like an LLM call.

## A simple thread

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
import time
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

@client.step(type="llm")
def my_llm(input: str): # fake LLM call
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Response from the llm"

def main():
    user_query = "Hello World"
    # You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id
    with client.thread() as thread:
      print(thread.id)
      client.message(content=user_query, type="user_message", name="User")
      llm_response = my_llm(user_query)
      client.message(content=llm_response, type="assistant_message", name="Assistant")

main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient } from '@literalai/client';

const client = new LiteralClient(process.env['LITERAL_API_KEY']);

// You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id
const thread = client.thread();

const step = await thread
  .step({ type: "run", name: "firstStep" })
  .send();
```
