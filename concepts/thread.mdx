title: "Thread"
---

A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be, for example, a conversation between a human and one or several assistants, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input.

A Thread is composed of [Steps](/concepts/step). A Step can be a message, or an intermediate AI step like an LLM call.

    time.sleep(1)
    response = "My assistant response"
    client.message(content=response, type="assistant_message", name="Assistant")
    return response
