title: "Thread"

A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be a conversation between a human and one or several agents, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input...

A Thread is composed of Steps. A Step can be a message, or an internal AI step like an LLM call.

from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()

@client.step(type="tool")
async def my_tool():
    # do something

    return "Response from the tool"

async def main():
    tool_response = await my_tool()

    client.message(content=tool_response, type="assistant_message")
    print(tool_response)

## Thread API

There are two ways to create thread. Using the `with` statement or using the decorator on a function.
