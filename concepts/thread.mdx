title: "Thread"

A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be, for example, a conversation between a human and one or several assistants, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input.

A Thread is composed of [Steps](/concepts/step). A Step can be a message, or an intermediate AI step like an LLM call.

## A simple thread

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import time
from literalai import LiteralClient
client = LiteralClient()

@client.step(type="tool")
def my_tool(input: str): # do something
    time.sleep(1)
    return "Response from the tool"

@client.thread
def main():
    tool_response = my_tool("Hello world")
    client.message(content=tool_response, type="assistant_message", name="Chatbot")
    print(tool_response)

main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()

```
