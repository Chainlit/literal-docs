title: "Thread"
---

A Thread represents a group of interactions between a user and an AI app. It can be, for example, a conversation between a human and one or several assistants, or an agent generating a document piece by piece from a user input.

A Thread is composed of [Steps](/concepts/step). A Step can be a message, or an intermediate AI step like an LLM call.

## Log a Thread

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
import time
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

@literal_client.step(type="run")
def my_assistant(input: str):
    # Implement your assistant logic here
    time.sleep(1)
    response = "My assistant response"
    literal_client.message(content=response, type="assistant_message", name="Assistant")
    return response

def main():
    # You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id
    with literal_client.thread(name="Thread Example") as thread:
      print(thread.id)
      user_query = "Hello World"
      literal_client.message(content=user_query, type="user_message", name="User")
      my_assistant(user_query)

      # Let's say the user has a follow up question
      follow_up_query = "Follow up!"
      literal_client.message(content=follow_up_query, type="user_message", name="User")
      my_assistant(user_query)

main()
# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# WARNING: If you run a continuous server, you should not use this method.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, Thread } from "@literalai/client";

const literalClient = new LiteralClient(process.env["LITERAL_API_KEY"]);

// The Assistant could have intermediary steps
async function myAssistant(thread: Thread, query: string) {
  const run = thread.step({
    type: "run",
    name: "My Assistant Run",
    input: { content: query },
  });

  // Implement your assistant logic here
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 1000));
  const response = { content: "My assistant response" };

  run.output = response;
  await run.send();

  return response;
}

async function main() {
  const participantId = await literalClient.api.getOrCreateUser("John Doe");

  // You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id
  const thread = await literalClient
    .thread({ name: "Thread Example", participantId: participantId })
    .upsert();

  console.log(thread.id);

  const userQuery = "Hello World";
  await thread
    .step({
      type: "user_message",
      name: "User",

  await thread
    .step({

      name: "Assistant",
      output: assistantResponse,
    })
    .send();

  const followUpQuery = "Follow up!";

    .step({

## Visualize Threads on Literal

Navigate to the `Threads` page on the platform to see Threads. There, you can click on single Threads (conversations). 

On the left (1), you can see the conversation and the steps that the application has taken in order to produce an answer. Different kind of steps have different colors. You can click on each step to view more details on the right side of the screen. Here, you can view [Metadata](/concepts/step#metadata) (2) and add [Scores](/concepts/score) (3).

On the top (4), you can add tags to the Thread. You can also add Tags to a single step in this Thread, on the right (5).

Finally, you can add a Step to a Dataset (6), for example for evaluation purposes.

## Tags

You can add Tags to Threads, Steps and Generations. Visit [this page](/concepts/tags) for information on how to use Tags.
