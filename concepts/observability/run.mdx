title: "Run"
---

A `run` signifies the execution of an agent or a chain that takes multiple steps. It is a sequence of Steps, that, unlike other Step types, does not have to be part of a Thread. This is useful if you are monitoring non-conversational use cases. Interact with a Run inside a Thread [here](https://cloud.getliteral.ai/thread/b3b61ec8-0d8a-444d-9e70-d6929c1129d1). 

`Runs` are visualized as part of Thread on the `Threads` page, but they can also be viewed on their own `Runs` page on Literal AI. Here, all Runs are visualized, not only runs that are part of Threads. Runs have a unique ID (different from the `Thread ID`, since Runs are different from Threads). The `Steps` in a Run can be scored and tagged as usual.

The example in the following image shows a Run called `Query` of a RAG chatbot agent, that Retrieves context documents and Generates an answer using a GPT-4 model.

In the following code example you can see that you can tag steps with the type `"Run"`, by writing :

* `@literal_client.step(type="run")` in Python 
* `literal_client.run()` in TypeScript (this is a helper function that creates a step with the type `run`, equivalent to `literal_client.step({ type: "run" })`).

```python Python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

# Here you can define the type of the step as run
@literal_client.step(type="run")
def my_run():
    # Implement your custom logic here
    return "Success"
    
my_run()

# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# WARNING: If you run a continuous server, you should not use this method.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient } from "@literalai/client";

const literalClient = new LiteralClient(process.env['LITERAL_API_KEY']);

// Run example
async function myRun() {
  return literalClient
    .run({
      name: 'My Run',
      input: { content: 'My run Input' }
    })
    .wrap(() => {
      // Implement your custom logic here
      return { content: 'Success' };
    });
}

async function main() {
  await myRun();
}
```
