The Chainlit client offers tools to create steps automatically when using existing librairies.

Right now we have one integration with OpenAI.

## OpenAI

When using the OpenAI python client, you can use the `instrument_openai` method to instrument the client.

```python
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()
client.instrument_openai()
```

This will create a step for each call to the OpenAI API.

Note that we only support the OpenAI python package starting at version `1.0.0`. And that we don't support the Assistant API yet.
