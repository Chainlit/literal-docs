A generation is an object that synthesizes all responses from an LLM model. A generation object can be passed to a [Step](/concepts/step) to ensure that we track all LLM interactions.

We handle two types of generations:

# Completion Generation

Completion generations refer to how the AI model completes or responds to a given prompt or part of a conversation. When the user inputs an initial prompt, the AI system generates a response that logically completes the prompt. For instance, if you prompt an AI model with "What's the weather?", it might complete your sentence with something like "It's sunny with a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius."

# Chat Generation

Chat generations refer to an AI's ability to create a series of interconnected responses, enabling it to carry on full conversations. It can be reactive (responding to user prompts) and proactive (initiating conversations or introducing new topics). For example, in a customer service scenario, the AI could greet a visitor or offer assistance autonomously.

On the platform, you can list all generations on the generation page and access their details.
