# Chat Generation

Chat generations refer to an AI's ability to create a series of interconnected responses, enabling it to carry on full conversations. It can be reactive (responding to user prompts) and proactive (initiating conversations or introducing new topics). For example, in a customer service scenario, the AI could greet a visitor or offer assistance autonomously.

On the platform, you can list all generations on the generation page and access their details.
