## How to get my API key?

To get your API key, go to your project page and click on the "Settings" tab. You will find your API key in the "API Key" section.

## How to configure the Literal client?

You can use the Literal API key in two ways to configure the Literal client:

1. Pass it to the `LiteralClient` constructor:

```python
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

2. Set the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable, you can then instantiate the client without passing the api key:

```python
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient()
```

Our recommendation is to store the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable in a `.env` file and to load it using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

```python
from literalai import LiteralClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

client = LiteralClient()
```
