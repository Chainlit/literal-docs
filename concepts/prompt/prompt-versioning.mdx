On the `Prompts` dashboard, you can see which prompts are present and running (`Champion Version`). By clicking on a prompt, you get to a page where you can see which versions of that prompt are saved. By clicking on a version number, you enter the [`Playground`](/concepts/prompt/prompt-playground), where you can change this prompt, or promote this prompt template to the `Champion Version`.
