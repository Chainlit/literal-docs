title : Feedback

End user can leave feedback on their interaction with your LLM app. 

<Frame caption="The feedback page">     
  <img
    src="/images/feedback.png"
    alt="A list of feedback left by users on steps"
  />
</Frame>

You can mark those feedbacks as reviewed to keep improving your LLM app.

Feedbacks can have many strategies: 
- Binary: -1 or 1 
- Stars: from 1 to 5
- Big stars: from 1 to 10
- Likert: likert scale
- Continuous: numerical value
- letters: A through F
- percentage: 1 to 100

Currently the frontend only handles the binary feedback.
