A Step is a fundamental building block within a [Thread](/concepts/thread) that represents a single unit of interaction or operation.

Steps are versatile and can encompass various types of activities, such as sending a message, making a call to a large language model (LLM), or executing a custom function.

By organizing interactions into Steps, the Literal platform enables users to structure, visualize, and analyze the flow of conversations or processes in a granular and meaningful way.

## Types of Steps

There are several types of Steps, each serving a distinct purpose:

### Run

A `run` step signifies the execution of an agent or a chain that takes multiple steps. Unlike other step types, it does not have to be part of a Thread.

This is useful if you are monitoring non conversational use cases.

### Message

A `message` step represents a message exchange within a Thread. There are two primary subtypes of message steps:

- **User Message**: This type of step is used to log messages sent by the user. It helps in tracking user inputs and requests.
- **Assistant Message**: This step logs messages generated by the assistant or application in response to user inputs.

### Tool

A `tool` step is used to document interactions with external tools or services. This step type is particularly useful for applications that interact with external APIs, databases, or services.

### LLM

An `llm` step is used to document interactions with large language models (LLMs). This step type is particularly useful for applications that leverage AI models, such as GPT-3, for generating responses, content, or performing analysis.

## Implementing Steps

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient


client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

@client.step(type="tool")
def my_tool():
    # Implement your custom logic here
    return "Success"

# You can change the step type
@client.step(type="run")
def my_run():
    # Implement your custom logic here
    my_tool()
    return "Success"

with client.thread() as thread:
    client.message(content="Hello World", type="assistant_message", name="My Assistant")
    my_run()
    
# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# This step is not required for code that runs continuously in production.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, Step, Thread } from "@literalai/client";

const client = new LiteralClient('your_api_key');

// Tool example
async function myTool(run: Step) {
  const tool = run.step({
    name: "My Tool",
    type: "tool",
    input: { content: "My Tool Input" },
  });

  // Implement your custom logic here
  const response = { content: "Success" };

  tool.output = response;
  await tool.send();

  return response;
}

// Run example
async function myRun(thread: Thread) {
  const run = thread.step({
    name: "My Run",
    type: "run",
    input: { content: "My run Input" },
  });

  await myTool(run);

  // Implement your custom logic here
  const response = { content: "Success" };

  run.output = response;
  await run.send();

  return response;
}

async function main() {
  const thread = client.thread();
  // Message example
  await thread
    .step({
      output: { content: "Hello World" },
      type: "assistant_message",
      name: "My Assistant",
    })
    .send();

  await myRun(thread);
}

```
