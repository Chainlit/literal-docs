A Step is a container of work in a Thread. It can be nested to include several children Steps.

## A simple step

In this example, we create a step with the decorator. The step is automatically sent to the Chainlit platform. The type is set to `tool` to convey that the function contains a tool used by an AI assistant.

Note that we call `client.wait_until_queue_empty()` to make sure all messages and steps are sent to the Chainlit platform before the program exits.

<CodeGroup>
```python step-example.py
import time
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()


@client.step(type="tool")
def my_tool():
    # do something

    time.sleep(1)

    return "Response from the tool"


@client.thread
def main():
    tool_response = my_tool()

    client.message(content=tool_response, type="assistant_message")
    print(tool_response)


main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step API

There are three ways to create steps. Using the `with` statement, using the decorator on a function, or using the `start_step` method.

    Use `start_step` when you want fine-grained control over your step.
