A Step is a container of work in a Thread. It can be nested to include several children Steps.

A Step can be one of the following types:

- `run`: A generic step
- `tool`: A step that runs a tool
- `llm`: A step that runs a language model
- `embedding`: A step that runs an embedding model
- `retrieval`: A step that retrieves documents
- `rerank`: A step that reranks documents
- `undefined`: An undefined step


A Step can also represent Messages in a Thread. In this case, the Step will have a `type` field that can be one of the following:

- `user_message`: A message from the user
- `system_message`: A message from the system
- `assistant_message`: A message from the assistant

You can either set use the auto-generated step ids, or use custom ones to match your own system. Step ids must be unique across your project.
