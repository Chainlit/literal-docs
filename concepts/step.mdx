<CodeGroup>
```python step-example.py
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()

@client.step(type="tool")
async def my_tool():
    # do something

    return "Response from the tool"

async def main():
    tool_response = await my_tool()

    client.message(content=tool_response, type="assistant_message")
    print(tool_response)

## Step API

There are three ways to create steps. Using the `with` statement, using the decorator on a function, or using the `start_step` method.
