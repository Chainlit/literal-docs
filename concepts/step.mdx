A Step is a container of work in a Thread. It can be nested to include several children Steps.

## A simple step

In this example, we create a step with the decorator. The step is automatically sent to the platform. The type is set to `tool` to convey that the function contains a tool used by an AI assistant.


<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"""
Note that we call `client.wait_until_queue_empty()` to make sure all messages and
steps are sent to the platform before the program exits.
"""

from literalai import LiteralClient
client = LiteralClient()

@client.step(type="run")
def my_step(input):
  return f"World"

@client.thread
def main():
  print(my_step("Hello"))

main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
print("Done")

```

Here is how it looks on the platform:
