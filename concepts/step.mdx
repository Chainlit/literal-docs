title: "Step"

A Step is a container of work in a Thread. It can be nested to include several children Steps.

## A simple step

In this example, we create a step with the decorator. The step is automatically sent to the platform. The type is set to `tool` to convey that the function contains a tool used by an AI assistant.


<CodeGroup>
```python Python
"""
Note that we call `client.wait_until_queue_empty()` to make sure all messages and
steps are sent to the platform before the program exits.
"""
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient
client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

@client.step(type="tool")
def child_step():
  return "I am child"

@client.step(type="run")
def parent_step():
  child_step()
  return "I am the parent"


def main():
  # You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id
  with client.thread() as thread:
    parent_step()

main() 
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient } from '@literalai/client';

const client = new LiteralClient(process.env['LITERAL_API_KEY']);

// You can continue a thread by passing the thread id
const thread = client.thread();
const step = await thread
  .step({ type: 'run', output: 'Hello', name: 'parent_step' })
  .send();

const childStep = step.childStep({
  name: 'child_step',
  type: 'tool',
  input: 'Hello'
});
```

## Visualize the run on Literal

Navigate to the `Runs` page on the platform to see the run you just created.
