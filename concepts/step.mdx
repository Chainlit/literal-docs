A Step is a container of work in a Thread. It can be nested to include several children Steps.

## A simple step

In this example, we create a step with the decorator. The step is automatically sent to the platform. The type is set to `tool` to convey that the function contains a tool used by an AI assistant.

Note that we call `client.wait_until_queue_empty()` to make sure all messages and steps are sent to the platform before the program exits.

<CodeGroup>
```python
from literalai import LiteralClient
client = LiteralClient()
@client.step(type="run")
def my_step(input):
return f"World"

@client.thread
def main():
print(my_step("Hello"))

main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
print("Done")

```
</CodeGroup>

Here is how it looks on the platform:

## Step API

There are three ways to create steps. Using the `with` statement, using the decorator on a function, or using the `start_step` method.

  <Card title="Step decorator" icon="at" href="/python-client/usage/create-a-step#using-the-with-statement">
    Use the decorator on your step function.
  </Card>
  <Card title="With statement" icon="w" href="/python-client/usage/create-a-step#using-the-decorator-on-a-function">
    Use the with statement when your step is not a function.
  </Card>
  <Card title="start_step" icon="code" href="/python-client/usage/create-a-step#using-the-start-step-method">
    Use `start_step` when you want fine-grained control over your step.
