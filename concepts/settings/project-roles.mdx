title: Projects & Roles
---

With the ability to create projects on Literal AI, you can compartmentalize different parts of your LLM Product.

### Creating & inviting members to a Project

To start a new project, navigate to the bottom part and create a new project.

Once a project is created, you can invite others to collaborate:

1. Go to the project settings.
2. Invite members by entering their email addresses.
3. Assign roles to each member.

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Literal AI supports role based access control to help teams manage access to the resources.
Project administrators are responsible for assigning roles to the team members, each role has a different set of permissions.

**Supported roles:**
- **Admin**: Full access to the project. Can manage members, settings, and all project resources.
- **AI Engineer**: Can manage threads, generate API keys, manage prompts and rules. Can't manage project settings or members.
- **Domain Expert**: Can read observability data, score and tag the data. Limited access to other project resources.

### Managing Literal AI API Keys

You can then navigate to the "Settings > General" tab in your project, access the "Literal AI API Keys" section, generate a new API key, and use it in your application.

### Managing LLM API Keys

You can find more information on managing your credentials [here](/concepts/prompt#credentials).

- **LLM Providers**: Set up credentials for LLM providers like Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Mistral.
- **Tags**: Organize project threads and steps with tags. Add or remove as needed.
