title: Projects & Roles
---

With the ability to create projects on Literal AI, you can compartmentalize different parts of your LLM Product.

### Creating & inviting members to a Project

To start a new project, navigate to the bottom part and create a new project.

Once a project is created, you can invite others to collaborate:

1. Go to the project settings.
2. Invite members by entering their email addresses.
3. Assign roles to each member.

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Project administrators hold the responsibility of assigning and managing permissions for all team members. Permissions in Literal AI are packaged as the following set of roles :

####Supported roles

- **Admin**: Full access to the project, including team management, project settings, and all resources.
- **AI Engineer**: Manages observability data, API keys, and AI prompts. Cannot alter project settings or team roles.
- **Domain Expert**: Reads observability data, scores, and tags data. Limited access to project resources and no API key or project settings management.

Feel free to reach out to us to create a custom role: contact@literalai.com

| | Admin | AI Engineer | Domain Expert |

| Annotations (scores, tags...) | Read & Write | Read & Write | Read & Write |
| Observability (threads, steps...) | Read & Write | Read & Write | Read |
| Datasets (items, experiments...) | Read & Write | Read & Write | Read |
| Prompt (playground, versions...) | Read & Write | Read & Write |  |
