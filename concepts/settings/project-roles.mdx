title: Projects & Roles
---

With the ability to create projects on Literal AI, you can compartmentalize different parts of your LLM Product.

### Creating & inviting members to a Project

To start a new project, navigate to the bottom part and create a new project.

Once a project is created, you can invite others to collaborate:

1. Go to the project settings.
2. Invite members by entering their email addresses.
3. Assign roles to each member.

### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Project administrators hold the responsibility of assigning and managing permissions for all team members. Permissions in Literal AI are packaged as the following set of roles :

**Supported roles:**
- **Admin**: Admins have full, unrestricted access to the entire project. They can manage all aspects of the project, including adding and removing team members, modifying project settings, and accessing and altering all project resources. Admins are responsible for the overall governance of the project, ensuring smooth operations and compliance with organizational policies.
- **AI Engineer**: AI Engineers have specific access tailored to their technical responsibilities. They can manage observability data, generate and manage API keys, and create and modify prompts and rules necessary for the AI's evaluation. However, they do not have permissions to alter project settings or manage team member roles. AI Engineers focus on the technical implementation and maintenance of AI models observability, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Domain Expert**: Domain Experts have a specialized set of permissions, allowing them to read observability data. They can also score and tag data, providing insights based on their expertise. Domain Experts have limited access to broader project resources and do not manage API keys, or project settings. Their role is to interpret data and provide feedback that enhances the project's data, ensuring outputs align with domain-specific requirements.

### Managing Literal AI API Keys

You can then navigate to the "Settings > General" tab in your project, access the "Literal AI API Keys" section, generate a new API key, and use it in your application.

### Managing LLM API Keys

Project-level settings in Literal AI:

- **LLM Providers**: Set up credentials for LLM providers like Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Mistral.
- **Tags**: Organize project threads and steps with tags. Add or remove as needed.
- **Score Templates**: Craft score templates to assess LLM application performance.
