title: "Run"
---

A `run` signifies the execution of an agent or a chain that takes multiple steps. It is a sequence of Steps, that, unlike other Step types, does not have to be part of a Thread. This is useful if you are monitoring non-conversational use cases.

`Runs` are visualized as part of Thread on the `Threads` page, but they can also be viewed on their own `Runs` page on Literal. Here, all Runs are visualized, not only runs that are part of Threads. Runs have a unique ID (different from the `Thread ID`, since Runs are different from Threads). The `Steps` in a Run can be scored and tagged as usual.

The example in the following image shows a Run called `Query` of a RAG chatbot agent, that Retrieves context documents and Generates an answer using a GPT-4 model.

In the following code example you can see that you can tag steps with the type `"Run"`, by writing `@client.step(type="run")` in Python or `@client.step(type="run")` in TypeScript:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

# Here you can define the type of the step as run
@client.step(type="run")
def my_run():
    # Implement your custom logic here
    return "Success"

with client.thread() as thread:
    client.message(content="Hello World", type="assistant_message", name="My Assistant")
    my_run()
    
# Network requests by the SDK are performed asynchronously.
# Invoke flush_and_stop() to guarantee the completion of all requests prior to the process termination.
# WARNING: If you run a continuous server, you should not use this method.
client.flush_and_stop()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient, Step, Thread } from "@literalai/client";

const client = new LiteralClient('your_api_key');

// Run example
async function myRun(thread: Thread) {
  const run = thread.step({
    name: "My Run",
    type: "run",
    input: { content: "My run Input" },
  });

  // Implement your custom logic here
  const response = { content: "Success" };

  run.output = response;
  await run.send();

  return response;
}

async function main() {
  const thread = client.thread();
  // Message example
  await thread
    .step({
      output: { content: "Hello World" },
      type: "assistant_message",
      name: "My Assistant",
    })
    .send();

  await myRun(thread);
}

```
