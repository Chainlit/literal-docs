title: Projects & Roles
---

With the ability to create projects on Literal, you can compartmentalize different parts of your LLM Product.

### Creating & inviting members to a Project

To start a new project, navigate to the bottom part and create a new project.

Once a project is created, you can invite others to collaborate:

1. Go to the project settings.
2. Invite members by entering their email addresses.
3. Assign roles to each member:
   - **Admin**: Full access to the project.
   - **User**: Read-only access to the project.

### Managing API Keys

You can then navigate to the "Settings" tab in your project, access the "API Keys" section, generate a new API key, and use it in your application.

### Project-level settings

Project-level settings in Literal:

- **LLM Providers**: Set up credentials for LLM providers like Groq, Anthropic, OpenAI, and Mistral.
- **Tags**: Organize project threads and steps with tags. Add or remove as needed.
- **Score Templates**: Craft score templates to assess LLM application performance.

See documentation for setup details or contact support for help.
