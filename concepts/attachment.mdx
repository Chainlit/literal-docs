In LLM apps such as RAGs, users can send attachements.

On literal, we host those attachements adding them to steps so you can review them.

<Frame caption="An attachment">
  <img
    src="/images/attachment.png"
    alt="An attachment on a step"
  />
</Frame>

To create an attachment:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
attachment = await client.api.create_attachment(
    thread_id="<THREAD_UUID>",
    step_id="<STEP_UUID>"
    name="my_attachment",
    content_type="text/plain",
    content="Hello world",
)
```
</CodeGroup>
