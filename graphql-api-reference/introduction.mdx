If you don't want to use the [Python](/python-client) or [TypeScript](/typescript-client) client for interaction with Literal, or you are programming in another language, you can use Literal's GraphQL API endpoint. 

The API url is: `https://cloud.getliteral.ai/api/graphql`. If you follow that link, and you have previously logged into the Literal platform, you can see the GraphQL query documentation and you can make queries. The button on the top left corner leads you to the documentation (1).

There are two types of GraphQL functions: `Query` and `Mutation`. Use a `Query` if you want to fetch data or information from Literal, and `Mutation` if you want add, update or delete data.

You can build queries using the `GraphiQL Explorer` (2).

You can make GraphQL requests via cURL. To make a query, do a `HTTP POST` request, since all GraphQL API requests use the `POST` method. Make sure you pass your Literal API key.

A query to fetch the `id` and `name` of all `Datasets` in Literal:

```bash
curl -X POST https://cloud.getliteral.ai/api/graphql \
-H "x-api-key: $LITERAL_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "query": "query MyQuery { datasets(projectId: \"PROJECT_NAME\") { edges { node { id name } } } }" }'
```

A Mutation query to create a new prompt:
```bash
curl -X POST https://cloud.getliteral.ai/api/graphql \
-H "x-api-key: $LITERAL_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{ "query": "mutation MyMutation { createPromptLineage(name: \"NewPrompt\", projectId: \"PROJECT_NAME\") { id } }" }'
```
