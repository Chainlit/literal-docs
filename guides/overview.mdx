Welcome to the Literal AI guides and tutorials. This section is split into *how-to guides* and *tutorials*. 

* **How-to guides** are short guides that give you directions that guide you through a problem or towards a goal. These guides are goal-oriented. How-to guides are split into three sections: Prompt, Observability and Evaluation.
* **Tutorials** are experiences that take place under guidance. This can be full-blown use cases, and are usually longer than how-to guides. Tutorials are learning-oriented.

Most of the how-to guides and tutorials contain code. For the tutorials that are presented here you can also see the source code, in the [Github Cookbooks repo](https://github.com/Chainlit/literal-cookbook/).
