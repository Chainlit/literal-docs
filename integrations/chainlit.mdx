To start monitoring your Chainlit application, just set the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key and run your application as you normally would.

Literal AI will automatically start monitoring your application and send data to the Literal AI platform.

You **DO NOT** need to add any additional code, such as Literal AI decorators or instrumentation, to your application to start monitoring it with Literal AI.
