To start monitoring your Chainlit application, just set the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable to your API key and run your application as you normally would.

Literal will automatically start monitoring your application and send data to the Literal platform.

You **DO NOT** need to add any additional code, such as literal decorators or instrumentation, to your application to start monitoring it with Literal.
