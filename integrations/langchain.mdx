The Langchain integration enables to monitor your Langchain agents and chains with a single line of code.

```python Python
"""
You need to call the `client.langchain_callback()` to get a langchain callback. 
Then, you can use it in your langchain calls.
Note that you should call the `client.langchain_callback()` for each invocation.
"""

from literalai import LiteralClient

cb = client.langchain_callback()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { LiteralClient } from '@literalai/client';

const client = new LiteralClient(process.env['LITERAL_API_KEY']); // This is the default and can be omitted

// Literal thread ID is optional
const cb = client.instrumentation.langchain.literalCallback("OPTIONAL_LITERAL_THREAD_ID");
