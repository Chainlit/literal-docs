title: Overview
---

Literal AI is an all in one **observability**, **evaluation** and **analytics** platform for building **production-grade LLM apps**. Literal AI offers [multimodal logging](/concepts/multimodal), including vision, audio, and video.

It covers a wide range of use cases, from conversational applications to task automation. Literal AI can be used with any LLM framework, for example [Chainlit](/integrations/chainlit) and [LangChain](/integrations/langchain). It integrates well with many LLM providers, like [OpenAI](/integrations/openai), [Anthrophic and Mistral](/integrations/llm-providers).

Literal AI is developed by the builders of [Chainlit](https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit), the open-source Conversational AI Python framework.
