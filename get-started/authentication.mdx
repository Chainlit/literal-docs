## How to get my API key?

To get your API key, go to your [project page](https://cloud.getliteral.ai) and click on the "Settings" tab. You will find your API key in the "API Key" section.

## How to configure the Literal client?

You can use the Literal API key in two ways to configure the Literal client:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

#Â You can also set the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable, you can then instantiate the client without passing the api key:
client = LiteralClient()

"""
Our recommendation is to store the `LITERAL_API_KEY` environment variable
in a `.env` file and to load it using python-dotenv
"""
from literalai import LiteralClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

client = LiteralClient()

```

</CodeGroup>
