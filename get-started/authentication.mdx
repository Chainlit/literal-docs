## How to get my API key?

To get your API key, go to your [project page](https://cloud.getliteral.ai) and click on the "Settings" tab. You will find your API key in the "API Key" section.

## How to configure the Literal client?

You can use the Literal API key in two ways to configure the Literal client:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from literalai import LiteralClient

# You need to set the LITERAL_API_KEY environment variable 
client = LiteralClient() # or pass the key as `api_key` parameter
```
</CodeGroup>
