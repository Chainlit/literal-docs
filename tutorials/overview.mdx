**Tutorials** are experiences that take place under guidance. This can be full-blown use cases, and are usually longer than how-to guides. Tutorials are learning-oriented.

Most of the tutorials contain code. You can find the final source code for each tutorial in the [Github Cookbooks repo](https://github.com/Chainlit/literal-cookbook/).
