You can use the Chainlit api key in two ways to configure the Chainlit SDK:

1. Pass it to the `ChainlitClient` constructor:

```python
sdk = ChainlitClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

2. Set the `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable. Our recommendation is to store it in a .env file and load it using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

sdk = ChainlitClient()
```
