This guide assumes that you have set up a `.env` file with your API key. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [authentication guide](/python-client/get-started/authentication).

Copy the following code in a file called `step-example.py`:

```python step-example.py
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

client = ChainlitClient()

@client.step(type="run")
def my_step(input):
    return f"World" 


@client.thread
def main():
    print(my_step("Hello"))


main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
print("Done")
```

Run the code, you should see something similar to the following output:

```bash
$ python step-example.py
World
Done
```

Now you can go the cloud platform and see your step in the thread view:

<Frame caption="The result in Chainlit platform">
  <img src="/images/one-step.png" alt="One step thread in the Chainlit platform" />
</Frame>
