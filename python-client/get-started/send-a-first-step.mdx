This guide assumes that you have setup a `.env` file with your API key. If you haven't done so, please refer to the [authentication guide](/python-client/get-started/authentication).

Copy the following code in a file called `step-example.py`:

```python step-example.py
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

client = ChainlitClient()

@client.thread
def main():
    with client.step(type="tool") as step:
      step.metadata = {"hello": "world"}

main()
client.wait_until_queue_empty()
print("Done")
```

Run the code, you should see something similar to the following output:

```bash
$ python step-example.py
In step 4956b1be-7145-4a3c-a1b7-318f61a80038
Done
```

Now you can go the cloud platform and see your step in the thread view:
