title: Installation
---

To install the Python client, run the following command:

```bash
pip install literalai
```

You can use the Literal Python client synchronous or asynchonous. For trying it out on small scale, you can use the synchronous version. If you move to production, you'll want to use asynchronous functions. All functions can be used both sync or async, except for functions on `Dataset`, which are always sync. All examples in the documentation are, for simplicity, using the synchronous client. If you want to use the async functions, make sure to `await` the functions.

To instantiate the synchronous client:

```python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY")) 
```

or, async:

```python
import os
from literalai import AsyncLiteralClient

async_client = AsyncLiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY")) 
```
