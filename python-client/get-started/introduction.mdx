title: Installation
---

To install the Python client, run the following command:

```bash
pip install literalai
```

You can use either the **synchronous** or **asynchronous** Literal AI Python client.  
To try it out on a small scale, you can use the synchronous version. If you move to production, you'll want to use asynchronous functions. All functions can be used both sync or async, except for functions on `Dataset`, which are always sync. All examples in the documentation are, for simplicity, using the synchronous client. If you want to use the async functions, make sure to `await` the functions.  

<Warning>The Python client is not compatible with gunicorn's `--preload` flag.</Warning>

To instantiate the synchronous client:

```python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY")) 
```

or, async:

```python
import os
from literalai import AsyncLiteralClient

async_literal_client = AsyncLiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY")) 
```

Additionally, you can pass the optional `batch_size` argument to batch multiple events - handled simultaneously by Literal. 
Events are batched up to `batch_size`. Defaults to 5.

<Warning>
    If you use the SDK in multiple Python files, do NOT create a new client at the top of each file, as that would break event ingestion.  
    Make sure to always rely on the same client instance.
</Warning>

#### Disable Decorators

When instantiating the client, you have the option to disable the decorators that comes with the SDK. This can be useful when you want to disable the decorators without changing the code. 

```python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"), disabled=True) # Disable decorators

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"), batch_size=5) # Batch events
```
