## How to get my API key?

You can get your API key in the Chainlit platform. Go to your project page and click on the "Settings" tab. You will find your API key in the "API Key" section.

## How to configure the Chainlit client?

You can use the Chainlit api key in two ways to configure the Chainlit client:

1. Pass it to the `ChainlitClient` constructor:

```python
client = ChainlitClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

2. Set the `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable, you can then instantiate the client without passing the api key:

```python
client = ChainlitClient()
```

Our recommendation is to store the `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable in a `.env` file and to load it using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

client = ChainlitClient()
```
