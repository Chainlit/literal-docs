You can use the Chainlit api key in two ways to configure the Chainlit client:

1. Pass it to the `ChainlitClient` constructor:

```python
client = ChainlitClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

2. Set the `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable, you can then instantiate the client without passing the api key:

```python
client = ChainlitClient()
```

Our recommendation is to store the `CHAINLIT_API_KEY` environment variable in a `.env` file and to load it using [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/).

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

client = ChainlitClient()
```
