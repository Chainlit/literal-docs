title: Manipulating entities
description: "Create Read Update and Delete methods for Chainlit platform entities"
---

If you prefer to manipulate Chainlit plateform entities without using instrumentation, here is a collection of methods to do so.
Checkout the [authentication](/python-client/authentication) page for more information on how to instanciate a client.

All entities have a `to_dict` method that will help you visualize its content.

## User

### Create an User

```python
from chainlit_client import ChainlitClient

client = ChainlitClient()
new_user = client.api.create_user(identifier="John Doe")
```

### Get an User

```python
user = client.api.get_user(id="1234")
```

<Warning>If the user does not exist `None` is returned</Warning>

### Update an User

```python
updated_user = client.api.update_user(id="1234", identifier="Jane Doe")
```

### Delete an User

```python
user = client.api.delete_user(id="1234")
```

## Thread

Checkout the documentation about [threads](/concepts/thread) for more information.

### Fetching threads

You can query threads with filter:

```python
threads = client.api.list_threads(first=None, after=None, filters=None)

print(threads["pageInfo"])
for thread in threads["data"]:
    print(thread.to_dict())
```

Filters is a dict that can contain the following keys:

```
attachmentsName
createdAt
afterCreatedAt
beforeCreatedAt
duration
environment
feedbacksValue
participantsIdentifier
search
tokenCount
```

You can also fetch a single thread by id

```python
thread = client.api.get_thread(id="1234")
```

### Update thread

```python
updated_thread = client.update_thread(
    id="1234",
    metadata=None,
    participant_id=None,
    environment=None,
    tags=None,
)
```

### Upsert tread

It will either create a new thread of update the existing one.

```python
thread = client.upsert_thread(
    metadata=None,
    participant_id=None,
    environment=None,
    tags=None
)
```

### Delete thread

```python
client.api.delete_thread(id="1234")
```
