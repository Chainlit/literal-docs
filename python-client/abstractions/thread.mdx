## Using the `with` statement

You can create a thread and execute code within it using the `with` statement:

```python
with client.thread() as thread:
    # do something
```

You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id to the `thread` method:

```python

previous_thread_id = "UUID"

with client.thread(thread_id=previous_thread_id) as thread:
    # do something
```
