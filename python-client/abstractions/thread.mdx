title: "Thread"
---

There are multiple ways to log Threads in your Python applications. 

## Using the `@literal_client.thread` decorator

Use this decorator before a function to initiate a Thread. This method is a simple and straighforward way of logging Threads. 

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import os
from literalai import LiteralClient

literal_client = LiteralClient(api_key=os.getenv("LITERAL_API_KEY"))

@literal_client.step(type="run")
def my_assistant(input: str):
    response = "My assistant response"
    literal_client.message(content=response, type="assistant_message", name="Assistant")
    return response

@literal_client.thread
def main():
    user_query = "Hello World"
    literal_client.message(content=user_query, type="user_message", name="User")
    my_assistant(user_query)

main()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the `with` statement

If you prefer to have more flexibility in logging Threads, you can use the `with` statement. You can create a thread and execute code within it using the `with` statement:

<CodeGroup>
```python
with literal_client.thread() as thread:
    # do something
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also continue a thread by passing the thread id to the `thread` method:

<CodeGroup>
```python

previous_thread_id = "UUID"

with literal_client.thread(thread_id=previous_thread_id) as thread:
    # do something
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using the Literal AI API client

You can also create Threads using the `literal_client.api.create_thread()` method.

<CodeGroup>
```python
thread = literal_client.api.create_thread(
    participant_id="<PARTICIPANT_UUID>",
    environment="production",
    tags=["tag1", "tag2"],
    metadata={"key": "value"},
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Using Chainlit

If you built your LLM application with Chainlit, you don't need to specify Threads in your code. Chainlit logs Threads for you by default.
