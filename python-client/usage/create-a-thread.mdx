title: "Create a thread"
---

The thread is the main entity of the Chainlit platform. It reprensents a conversation between the user and the AI assistant.

Declaring the thread is the first step to create a conversation containing [messages](/python-client/usage/create-a-message) and [steps](/python-client/usage/create-a-step).

There are two methods to create a thread:

1. Using the decorator on a function
2. Using the `with` statement

The thread is sent to the Chainlit platform when a first message or step is created.

By default, the thread id is a random uuid. You can set a custom id to match your own system. Thread ids must be unique across your project.

## Using the decorator on a function

If you want to create a thread from a function, you should use the `@client.thread` decorator.

Here is how to use the decorator:

```python
@client.thread
def my_thread():
    # do something
```

If you already have a thread id that you want to use, you can pass it to the decorator. Bear in mind that the thread id must be unique across all threads in your project.

```python
@client.thread(thread_id="my-thread-id")
def my_thread():
    # do something
```

You can access the thread object with the `get_current_thread_id` method:

```python
@client.thread
def my_thread():
    thread_id = client.get_current_thread_id()
    # do something
```

## Using the `with` statement

If you want to create a step from a block of code, you should use the `with` statement.

```python
with client.thread() as thread:
    # do something
```
