title: "Create a step"
---

There are three methods to create a step:

1. Using the `with` statement
2. Using the decorator on a function
3. Using the `step` method

## Using the `with` statement

```python
with client.step() as step:
    # do something
```

## Using the decorator on a function

The simplest way to create a step is to use the `@client.step` decorator on a function:

```python
@client.step
def my_step():
    # do something
```

If you already have a step id that you want to use, you can pass it to the decorator. Bear in mind that the step id must be unique across all steps in your project.

```python
@client.step(id="my-step-id")
def my_step():
    # do something
```

## Using the `step` method

You can also create a step using the `step` method. This method returns a `Step` object that you can use to finalize the step. Finalizing a step is mandatory to send the data to the Chainlit platform.

```python
step = client.step(i)
# do something
step.finalize()
```
