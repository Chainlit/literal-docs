title: "Create a step"

Steps are the building blocks of a [Thread](/concepts/thread). They represent a unit of work in a Thread. They can be nested to include several children Steps.

Note that Steps must be created inside a [Thread](/python-client/usage/create-a-thread).

There are three methods to create a step:

1. Using the decorator on a function
2. Using the `with` statement
3. Using the `start_step` method

The step is automatically sent to the Chainlit platform when the `.end()` method is called.

By default, the step id is a random uuid. You can set a custom id to match your own system. Step ids must be unique across the steps and messages of your project.

## Using the decorator on a function

If you want to create a step from a function, you should use the `@client.step` decorator.

The step is automatically ended and sent to the Chainlit platform when the function returns.

Another advantage of using the decorator is that you get several variables automatically set for you:

- `name`: The name of the step. This is automatically set to the function name.
- `input`: The input of the step. This is automatically set to the arguments of the function.
- `output`: The output of the step. This is automatically set to the return value of the function.

Here is how to use the decorator:

```python
@client.step
def my_step():
    # do something
```

If you want to override the default step parameters, you can pass them to the decorator:

```python
@client.step(id="my-step-id", name="My step", type="run")
def my_step():
    # do something
```

You can access the step object with the `get_current_step` method:

```python
@client.step
def my_step():
    step = client.get_current_step()
    # do something
```

## Using the `with` statement

If you want to create a step from a block of code, you should use the `with` statement.

The step is automatically ended and sent to the Chainlit platform when the code exits the `with` block.

```python
with client.step() as step:
    # do something
```

If you want to override the default step parameters, you can pass them to the `step` method:

```python
with client.step(id="my-step-id", name="My step", type="run") as step:
    # do something
```

## Using the `start_step` method

This method should be used as a last resort because it doesn't automatically end the step.

You must call the `end` method on the step object to end the step and send it to the Chainlit platform.

```python
step = client.start_step(i)
# do something
step.end()
```

You can either pass the step parameters to the `start_step` method, or set them directly on the step object:

```python
step = client.start_step(id="my-step-id", name="My step", type="run")
step.input = "test input"
# do something
step.output = "Hello world"
step.end()
```

## Step parameters

<ParamField path="thread_id" type="string" required>
  The id of the thread
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="id" type="string">
  The id of the step. If not provided, a random uuid will be generated. Use
  custom ones to match your own system. Step ids must be unique across your
  project.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="name" type="string" default=" ">
  The name of the step (automatically set to the function name if using the
  decorator)
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="type" type="StepType" default="undefined">
  The type of the step. A Step can be one of the following types:

- `run`: A generic step
- `tool`: A step that runs a tool
- `llm`: A step that runs a language model
- `embedding`: A step that runs an embedding model
- `retrieval`: A step that retrieves documents
- `rerank`: A step that reranks documents
- `undefined`: An undefined step

</ParamField>

<ParamField path="metadata" type="dict" default="{}">
  Metadata associated with the step. This enables you to add custom fields to
  your steps.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="parent_id" type="string">
  The id of the parent step. This enables you to create nested steps.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="start_time" type="string">
  The start time of the step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="end_time" type="string">
  The end time of the step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="created_at" type="string">
  The server-side creation time of the step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="input" type="string">
  The input of the step. This is automatically set to the arguments of the
  function if using the decorator.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="output" type="string">
  The output of the step. This is automatically set to the return value of the
  function if using the decorator.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tags" type="List[str]" default="[]">
  The tags of the step. This is a complimentary field to the metadata field. It
  enables you to add custom tags to your steps.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="generation" type="BaseGeneration">
  The generation object associated with the step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="feedback" type="Feedback">
  The feedback object associated with the step.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="attachments" type="List[Attachment]" default="[]">
  The attachments associated with the step.
</ParamField>
