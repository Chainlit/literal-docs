title: "Create a step"
---

There are three methods to create a step:

1. Using the `with` statement
2. Using the decorator on a function
3. Using the `step` method

## Using the `with` statement

```python
with sdk.step() as step:
    # do something
```

## Using the decorator on a function

The simplest way to create a step is to use the `@sdk.step` decorator on a function:

```python
@sdk.step
def my_step():
    # do something
```

If you already have a step id that you want to use, you can pass it to the decorator. Bear in mind that the step id must be unique across all steps in your project.

```python
@sdk.step(id="my-step-id")
def my_step():
    # do something
```

## Using the `step` method

You can also create a step using the `step` method:

```python
sdk.step(i)
