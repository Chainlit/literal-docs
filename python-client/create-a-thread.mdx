title: "Create a thread"
---

There are two methods to create a thread:

1. Using the `with` statement
2. Using the decorator on a function

## Using the `with` statement

```python
with sdk.thread() as thread:
    # do something
```

## Using the decorator on a function

The simplest way to create a thread is to use the `@sdk.thread` decorator on a function:

```python
@sdk.thread
def my_thread():
    # do something
```

If you already have a thread id that you want to use, you can pass it to the decorator. Bear in mind that the thread id must be unique across all threads in your project.

```python
@sdk.thread(thread_id="my-thread-id")
def my_thread():
    # do something
```
